        <h2>A simple script that asks all of your Venmo friends (or even friends' friends) a dollar  ðŸ’¸ </h2>

    <p>I love to use Venmo; it's just so convenient. But when I downloaded and opened the app very first time, I found that it is kind of weird to see public stream of strangers' private transaction. And I could even pay or charge those strangers some money. I didn't get why Venmo wanted to be a social network-ish service, but since it did, I could use it social network-ish; do stupid thing without any reason.</p>
    <p>Source code and usage examples are on my github repo.<br>
